### July 2024

In the rapidly evolving landscape of web development, the need for scalable and maintainable architectures is paramount. Traditional monolithic front-end applications often face challenges in scaling, maintainability, and development speed, especially as teams grow and applications become more complex. Micro frontends, an architectural style where a front-end application is decomposed into smaller, more manageable pieces, each owned by different teams, have emerged as a solution to these challenges.

The adoption of micro frontends aims to bring the benefits of microservices, such as independent deployments, technology diversity, and team autonomy, to the front-end world. However, implementing micro frontends introduces its own set of complexities, particularly in terms of module sharing, dependency management, and ensuring consistent user experiences across different parts of the application.

Some tools in existance today to support micro fronot end architecture. [Single Spa](https://single-spa.js.org/), [Module Federation](https://module-federation.io/), [Luigi Project](https://luigi-project.io/) and there are several more.

### ESModules

The state of ESModules in 2024 may have opened the possibility of easy micro front end architectures. together with services like [ESM SH](https://esm.sh/#docs), and remote importing of ESModules.

ESModules (ECMAScript Modules), a standardized module system in JavaScript that allows developers to import and export functions, objects, and primitives across different files. ESModules are natively supported by modern browsers, providing a lightweight, efficient way to load and manage dependencies directly in the browser without the need for bundling tools.

This preamble sets the stage for exploring the hypothesis that creating micro frontends with ESModules can significantly improve the modularity, scalability, and maintainability of large-scale web applications. By leveraging the inherent capabilities of ESModules, developers can achieve seamless integration of independently developed front-end modules, reducing the overhead associated with traditional module bundling and fostering a more agile and collaborative development environment.

### Some struggles with implementing micro front ends to be addressed

- Creating a simple local development lifecycle.
 
- Complex Integration:
Ensuring seamless integration of different micro frontends can be difficult, particularly when they are developed by separate teams using different technologies.

- Consistent User Experience:
Maintaining a consistent look and feel across various micro frontends is challenging, especially when different teams have varying design guidelines and implementation standards.

- Performance Issues:
Loading multiple micro frontends can lead to performance issues such as longer load times and increased resource usage.

- Dependency Management:
Handling shared dependencies across micro frontends without version conflicts requires careful planning and coordination.

- Routing and Navigation:
Implementing a cohesive routing mechanism that works seamlessly across different micro frontends can be complex.

- Inter-Module Communication:
Facilitating communication between different micro frontends while maintaining independence and avoiding tight coupling is challenging.

- Deployment and Versioning:
Coordinating the deployment of multiple micro frontends and managing their versions to ensure compatibility can be cumbersome.

- Security Concerns:
Ensuring security across multiple micro frontends, especially when they are developed and maintained by different teams, requires rigorous security practices.

- Testing and Debugging:
Testing and debugging a system composed of multiple micro frontends can be more complex compared to a monolithic application, necessitating more sophisticated tools and strategies.

- Learning Curve:
Teams need to adapt to new tools, technologies, and best practices for effectively implementing and managing micro frontends.
Addressing these challenges is critical for the successful adoption of a micro frontend architecture.
